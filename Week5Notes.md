## Stages of R & D _(Video 1)_

####Basic Research
* Development of scientific knowledge: the outcomes are difficult to protect. 
* Knowledge spillovers, or contacts. Prisoner's dilema, done in universities and labs.
* Can be protected by patents or copyright, if two firms develop similar products, whoever comes first wins. often leeds to patent races.

####Applied Research
* Application of scientific knowledge to the solution of a specific problem

####Product Development
* Identification of relevant consumers, tailor product to needs of the consumers

## Types of Innovations _(Video 2)_
Two types:
#### Product Innovation
* Improvement of an existing product
* Increase in willingness to pay of existing/potential buyers
* Example: New mixture of rubber that keeps the car stable at high speeds

#### Process Innovation
* Novel way of producting an existing product
* Reduction of production costs

## Drastic vs Incremental Innovation
#### Drastic Innovation
* The innovator can behave as a monopolist in the market (despite substitute products)
* Example: Development of electric car

#### Incremental Innovation
* The innovator can increase profits but its strategy is still restricted by other non-innovating firms
* Example: Improvement of battery unit that increases range or electric car
