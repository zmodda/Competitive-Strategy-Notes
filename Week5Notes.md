## Stages of R & D

####Basic Research
* Development of scientific knowledge: the outcomes are difficult to protect. 
* Knowledge spillovers, or contacts. Prisoner's dilema, done in universities and labs.
* Can be protected by patents or copyright, if two firms develop similar products, whoever comes first wins. often leeds to patent races.

####Applied Research
* Application of scientific knowledge to the solution of a specific problem

####Product Development
* Identification of relevant consumers, tailor product to needs of the consumers

## Types of Innovations
Two types:

#### Product Innovation
* Improvement of an existing product
* Increase in willingness to pay of existing/potential buyers
* Example: New mixture of rubber that keeps the car stable at high speeds

#### Process Innovation
* Novel way of producting an existing product
* Leads to reduction of production costs

## Drastic vs Incremental Innovation
#### Drastic Innovation
* The innovator can behave as a monopolist in the market (despite substitute products)
* Example: Development of electric car

#### Incremental Innovation
* The innovator can increase pr ofits but its strategy is still restricted by other non-innovating firms
* Example: Improvement of battery unit that increases range or electric car

## Incentives to Innovate

### Competitive Market
#### Example
* 100 consumers interested in motorbikes
  * 60 consumers would pay maximum 500 Euros
  * 40 consumers would pay maximum 400 Euros
* With current tecnology: total production costs of 300 Euros

* New process innovation: total production costs of 200 Euros

* Whoever spends most on the innovation gets the innovation
  * By being granted a patent or 
  * Being fist in the market

* Assume 10 companies producing and selling motorbikes in the competitive market
* Prior to innovation, all have the same production technology

##### Without Innovation
* Total production costs of 300 Euros
* Each company sets price equal to costs
* Each company makes profits of zero

##### With Innovation
* Total production costs of
  * 200 Euros for company that gets innovation
  * 300 Euros for all others
* Company with innovation can set a price of 299 Euros
* All consumers buy from this company
