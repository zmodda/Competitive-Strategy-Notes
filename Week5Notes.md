## Stages of R & D

####Basic Research
* Development of scientific knowledge: the outcomes are difficult to protect. 
* Knowledge spillovers, or contacts. Prisoner's dilema, done in universities and labs.
* Can be protected by patents or copyright, if two firms develop similar products, whoever comes first wins. often leeds to patent races.

####Applied Research
* Application of scientific knowledge to the solution of a specific problem

####Product Development
* Identification of relevant consumers, tailor product to needs of the consumers

## Types of Innovations
Two types:

#### Product Innovation
* Improvement of an existing product
* Increase in willingness to pay of existing/potential buyers
* Example: New mixture of rubber that keeps the car stable at high speeds

#### Process Innovation
* Novel way of producting an existing product
* Leads to reduction of production costs

## Drastic vs Incremental Innovation
#### Drastic Innovation
* The innovator can behave as a monopolist in the market (despite substitute products)
* Example: Development of electric car

#### Incremental Innovation
* The innovator can increase pr ofits but its strategy is still restricted by other non-innovating firms
* Example: Improvement of battery unit that increases range or electric car

## Incentives to Innovate

### Competitive Market
#### Example
##### Setup
* 100 consumers interested in motorbikes
  * 60 consumers would pay maximum 500 Euros
  * 40 consumers would pay maximum 400 Euros
* With current tecnology: total production costs of 300 Euros

* **New process innovation:** total production costs of 200 Euros

* Whoever spends most on the innovation gets the innovation
  * By being granted a patent or 
  * Being fist in the market

* Assume 10 companies producing and selling motorbikes in the competitive market
* Prior to innovation, all have the same production technology

##### Without Innovation
* Total production costs of 300 Euros
* Each company sets price equal to costs
* Each company makes profits of zero

##### With Innovation
* Total production costs of
  * 200 Euros for company that gets innovation
  * 300 Euros for all others
* Company with innovation can set a price of 299 Euros
* All consumers buy from this company
* The overall profits of the company that innovates are 100*(299-200) = 100*99 = 9900
* All other companies make zero profits

##### Value of Innovation
Value of innovation to the focul company
* Profits with innovation: 9900
* Profits withot innovation: 0
* 9900 is the value of innovation, how much each firm will be willing to pay to get patent that reduces the production costs.


### Monopolist
* Same Set Up as before.
* Monopolist
* 1 company producing and selling motorbikes
* No threat of entry of competitors

##### Without Innovation
* Production costs of 300 Euros
* **Monopolist sets price of 500 Euros**
  * 60 consumers buy motorbike
  * Profits are 60(500-300) = 60*200 = 12,000 <- best strategy here
* Monopolist sets price of 400 Euros
  * 100 consumers buy motorbike
  * Profits are 100(400-300) = 100*100 = 10,000

##### With Innovation
* Production costs of 200 Euros
* Monopolist sets price of 500 Euros
  * 60 consumers buy motorbike
  * Profits are 60(500-200) = 60*300=18,000
* Monopolist sets price of 400 Euros
  * 100 consumers buy motorbike
  * Profits are 100(400-200) = 100*200 = 20,000 <- best strategy here

##### Value of Innovation
* Value of innovation to the monopolist
  * Profits with innovation: 20,000
  * Profits without innovation: 12,000
* Value = 20,000 - 12,000 = 8,000

#### Comparison
Value of innovation
* Competitive Market: 9,900 Euros
* Monopolist: 8,000 Euros
* Replacement effect: For a given market structure, a monopolist has less incentive to innovate because of the higher level of pre-innovation profits.
